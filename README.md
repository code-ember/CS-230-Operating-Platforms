# TheGameRoom
Portfolio &amp; Project Three for SNHU CS-230 Operating Platforms Course

Module 8 Journal:
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. 

01. Who was the client? 
The Gaming Room.

02. What type of software did they want you to design? 
We use Java to develop a game app software that would follow a client/server model which would be used on different operating systems.

03. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I learned to read everything on the assignment page carefully and more than twice when it comes to the requirements and what chapters to read in advanced before starting the project is very important in having great outcomes over the entire project.

04. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The most helpful part of the Software Design Document is providing a description of the design system which allows myself to fully understand what is being built and how its fully expected.

05. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? 
By creating at least one iteration of each document when I was revising the sections in each document.

06. How would you improve it?
By adding a different version number to each revised document, so that I don't get myself confused when looking back at each document.

07. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? 
The clints are always right and they know what they want accomplished. So, once I can gather the data of what the best idea is as the developer. The I will need to interpret and analyze that idea to the best of my abilities.

08. Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The clint is very important to the developer and the whole team and once we start, we want to get everything working correctly the first time around. 

09. How did you approach designing software? 
By following a development process, or a life cycle process until the very end when it’s all compilated and the clint is pleased about the final results of the software.

10. What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Waterfall or Agile project management methods. Also, we all need to always keep up with the basic tools of project management: Scheduling, Time management, Communication, Finance, accounting, Organizing, workflow and planning.
